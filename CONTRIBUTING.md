## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Format

_This specification is inspired by and supersedes the [Brainclements commit message format](https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c)._

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.
This format leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs".
When the body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to the [Commit Message Body](#commit-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-footer) format describes what the footer is used for and the structure it must have.

#### <a name="commit-header"></a>Commit Message Header

```
<type>(<scope>)(!?): <short summary>
  │       │      │      │
  │       │      │      └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │      │
  │       │      └─⫸ Exclamation mark: breaking change
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: api|events|features|mixins|repositories
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.  
Exclamation mark is optional too, but it's used to mark breaking changes.

##### Type

Must be one of the following:

-   **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
-   **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: CircleCi, SauceLabs)
-   **docs**: Documentation only changes
-   **feat**: A new feature
-   **fix**: A bug fix
-   **perf**: A code change that improves performance
-   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

##### Scope

The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes:

-   `api`
-   `events`
-   `features`
-   `mixins`
-   `repositories`

There are currently a few exceptions to the "use package name" rule:

-   none/empty string: useful for `test` and `refactor` changes that are done across all packages (e.g. `test: add missing unit tests`) and for docs changes that are not related to a specific package (e.g. `docs: fix typo in tutorial`).

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

-   use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
-   don't capitalize the first letter
-   no dot (.) at the end

#### <a name="commit-body"></a>Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change.
You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the change.

#### <a name="commit-footer"></a>Commit Message Footer

The footer is optional and is used for two purposes:

-   To reference issues that this commit closes
-   To include information that doesn't fit in the header or body, such as a link to a file or a suggestion to review a pull request

The format for the footer is as follows:

```
Closes/Fixes #<issue number>
```

or

```
See pull request #<pull request number>
```

### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

-   information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
-   a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.

## <a name="adding-new-things-to-the-codebase"></a> Adding new things to the codebase

Before adding new things to the codebase, please consider the following:

-   Is this something that is useful for everyone?
-   There isn't already a PR for this?

If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then please follow the steps below:

1. Create a new branch from `main` with the name of the feature you are adding.
2. Add your feature.
3. Don't forget to add javadoc comments to your feature.
4. Create a PR from your branch to `main`.
5. Add a description of your feature and why you think it should be added.
